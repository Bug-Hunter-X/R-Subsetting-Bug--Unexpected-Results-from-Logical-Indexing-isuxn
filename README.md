# R Subsetting Bug: Unexpected Results from Logical Indexing

This repository demonstrates a common error in R related to subsetting data frames using logical indexing.  The bug arises from incorrect use of logical operators and indexing, resulting in unintended subset selection.

The `bug.r` file contains code that exhibits the error. The `bugSolution.r` file provides the correct solution.

This is a common mistake for those new to R or those who are not fully aware of the intricacies of R's logical operators and how they work in conjunction with data frame indexing.  Understanding operator precedence and correct syntax is crucial for accurate data manipulation in R.
